📌 Statement of Purpose

"Excel is the essential bridge between raw, messy data and clear, actionable business intelligence."

This project demonstrates an end-to-end BI workflow, from raw data ingestion to a fully annotated "Analysis" layer and dynamic "Dashboard."

🛠️ Technical Workflow
Data Cleaning (Power Query): Handled date/time formatting and ensured numerical consistency for Total, COGS, and Gross Income.

Analysis Logic:

Time-Series Analysis: Created a custom "Time of Day" dimension (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night) to identify peak traffic.

Profitability Calculation: Monitored the Gross Margin Percentage across branches to ensure pricing strategy alignment.

Annotation Layer: Unlike standard dashboards, I integrated a 📌 "Key Findings" section directly into the analysis to highlight non-obvious trends (e.g., the 53% Morning order concentration).

📊 Business Insights Extracted
Peak Performance: January is the highest revenue month ($116k).

Operational Bottleneck: Identified Saturday morning as the high-volume "Crunch Time" (505 units).

Leading Category: Food and Beverages ($56,145).
